# Sitemanager 

This tool was done for personal usage but if someone finds it useful feel free to use it.

## Usage

### Add site
To add a site execute the `add` script and it will create a directory with the sitename in the specified directory location as 2nd parameter or if 2nd parameter is not provided it will fallback to `/var/www` by default.
- `./add sitename.tld /var/www`

## Remove Site
- Coming soon

## TODO
- Apache Support
- Remove Support (nginx, apache)
- DB Support (store what sites are managed, etc)
